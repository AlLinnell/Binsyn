      SUBROUTINE OMEGA(R,V,VM,Q,OM)
C     SRT TO CALCULATE THE VARIABLE OM,THE KOPAL POTENTIAL FOR THE ROCHE 
C     MODEL,FROM THE GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL V      
C     R IS THE SEPARATION OF CENTERS OF THE STELLAR COMPONENTS,IN CM.    
C     VM IS THE MASS,IN GRAMS,OF THE STAR IN QUESTION      
C     FV IS THE RATIO OF THE STELLAR ROTATIONAL ANGULAR VELOCITY TO THE  
C     ORBITAL ANGULAR VELOCITY 
C     Q IS THE MASS RATIO,IN THE SENSE M2/VM,WHERE M2 IS THE MASS OF THE 
C     COMPANION  
C     OM IS THE CALCULATED ROCHE MODEL POTENTIAL,RETURNED TO THE PGM.
