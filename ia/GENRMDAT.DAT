Number of rim subdivision boundary values             NRM      : 17
* Equals one more than number of subdivisions
Number of segment divisions on each rim subdivision   NSG      : 91
* Equals one more than number of segments
Number of symmetrically-placed higher Temp subdiv.    NHT      :  1
* This is the number at each edge of the rim
Value of higher temperature                           TEMPH    : 8000.0
*
Value of lower temperature                            TEMPL    : 8000.0
*
Azimuthal width of 0.25P rim segment at elevated Teff DAZ1     :     0.0
* This is centered at azimuth 90 degrees
Temperature increment relative to rim Teff            DTMP1    :     0.0
* This is the increment for region DAZ1
Azimuthal width of 0.75P rim segment at elevated Teff DAZ2     :     0.0
* This is centered at azimuth 270 degrees
Temperature increment relative to rim Teff            DTMP2    :     0.0
