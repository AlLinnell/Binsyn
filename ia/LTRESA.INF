First control key                                    KCTRL1   :  0
*     If KCTRL1=0,plot first set of points individually
*     If KCTRL1=1,draw curve through first set of pts.
*     If KCTRL1=2,input only second set of points and
*          plot individually
Second control key                                   KCTRL2   :  0
*     If KCTRL2=0,input only first set of points
*     If KCTRL2=1,input both sets of points
Third control key                                    KCTRL3   :  0
*     If KCTRL3=0,input second set of points in
*          alternate format.See listing of LTCVP
*     If KCTRL3=1,input second set of points as VM,UT
Fourth control key                                   KCTRL4   :  1
*     If KCTRL4=0,normalize data set to be plotted
*     If KCTRL4=1,do not normalize data set.
*          In this case,the actual range of ordinates
*          will be spread over the assigned vertical
*          interval

First phase limit for plot                           PL1      : -0.30
*      Points whose phases are more negative than

Second phase limit for plot                          PL2      :  0.70
*      Points whose phases are more positive than
*           PL2 are excluded from the plot
Reference phase for determining max.of obs.curve     RFRG     :  0.00
*      Points whose phase differs from RFRG by
*          more than 0.25 are not included in
*          search for maximum
