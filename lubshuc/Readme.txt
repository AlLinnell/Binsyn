Notes on Program LUBSHUC.F

1. The output files of this program mate with the plot program
	~/IDLWorkspace71/potplt3.pro
2. See the paper "Gas Dynamics of Semidetached Binaries", by Stephen H. Lubow
   and Frank H. Shu, 1975, ApJ, 198, 383.
3. The input file list is in ~/lubshuc/LUBSHUC.ILS
4. The input control file is in ~/lubshuc/LUBSHUC.INF
5. The equator profile of the loser, filling its Roche lobe, is in
   ~/lubshuc/LUBSHU1.DAT
6. The Roche lobe outline around the gainer is in
   ~/lubshuc/LUBSHU2.DAT
7. The outline of the accretion disk rim is in
   ~/lubshuc/LUBSHU3.DAT
8. The outline of the gainer equator is in
   ~/lubshuc/LUBSHU4.DAT
9. The coordinates of the center of the loser are in
   ~/lubshuc/LUBSHU5.DAT
10.The coordinates of the center of the gainer are in
   ~/lubshuc/LUBSHU6.DAT
11.The coordinates of the mass transfer stream are in
   ~/lubshuc/LUBSHUC7.DAT
12.The values of the acceleration vector are in
   ~/lubshuc/LUBSHUC8.DAT
13.File ~/lubshuc/LUBSHU9.DAT contains values of S, alpha, beta,
   gamma, chi, and nu.
14.File ~/lubshuc/LUBSHU10.DAT contains values of alpha, beta, gamma,
   chi, and nu
15.File ~/lubshuc/LUBSHU11.DAT contains values of the Jacobi integral
16.File ~/lubshuc/LUBSHU12.DAT is the main output file listing the
   characteristics of the solution.
17.The plot program ~/IDLWorkspace71/dnsplt.pro plots the density profile
   of the stream.
