This directory contains a number of test suites for testing and demonstrating features of Binsyn.
The separate test directories each contain a description of the test in that directory.
Test1 calculates a system model for an ordinary binary, including a file showing a plot of the system projected on the plane of the sky.
Test2 uses the same set of parameters as Test1 but calculates a complete 5500 Angstrom light curve.
Test3 calculates a 5500 Angstrom light curve for a contact binary system.
Test4 uses the same system parameters as Test1 but calculates a synthetic spectrum of the system.
Test5 solves a synthetic light curve by differentials corrections. One script sets up and tests the initial
model and a diferent script solves the light curve.
Setup1 produces a synthetic light curve modulated with simulated observational error.
