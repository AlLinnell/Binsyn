The intent of this test is to illustrate the basic sequential processing concept used by Binsyn.
Directory Test1 contains a copy of all the input files needed by the program sequence in this
test. The included script, script3, copies the input files to directory ia, then successively runs
the programs in this test, and finally copies important output files back to directory Test1.
In this way the user can examine the effect of changing a system parameter without changing to
a different directory.

Program CALPT sets the Roche potentials for the two stellar components via file CALPT.INF.
It is likely that the user will have an idea of the actual dimensions needed for the stellar
components. Determination of the corresponding Roche potentials involves an iterative process.
Initially choose large Roche potentials for the components (i.e., 10.0--15.0), guaranteeing that
the components will lie well within their Roche lobes. Run the script (./script3) and examine
file PGAX1.DAT. That file lists the properties of the system, including the critical Roche
potentials. Iteratively modify the Roche potentials in CALPT.INF and run script3 until the target
dimensions of the components are met.

PGB is set for a particular orbital inclination and a single orbital longitude. See file PGB.INF.
Computational results of the run are in file PGBX1.DAT.

PGC sets the radiative properties of the stellar components via file PGC.INF. See the discussion
in the Users Guide. Examine output file PGCX1.DAT for detailed information on
computed temperature profiles at various latitudes on the stellar components.

PGD integrates over the projections of the stellar components on the plane of the sky and tabulates
radiative properties, listed in file PGDX1.DAT. 

See the Users Guide for a description of program intercommunication.
