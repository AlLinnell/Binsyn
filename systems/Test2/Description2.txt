Test2 differs from Test1 in the number of orbital longitudes calculated; the geometry of the
components is the same (see Description1.txt in directory Test1 for details on setting the
geometry of the system). Test2 calculates a complete light curve of this eclipsing system for
a wavelength of 5500 Angstroms (set by file PGC.INF). The only changes from Test1 are in file
PGB.INF. Compare the PGB.INF file in directory Test2 with the corresponding PGB.INF file in
directory Test1.

Test2 script3 includes a call to the program ltcva. This program produces a file suitable for
plotting the light curve with an IDL program. In the present case there is a single color light curve, at 5500A, as specified by PGC.INF. NOTE! The run will end with a monitor notice that it cannot stat
THLC2.DAT. This is not a problem: the default is a 5 color plot. The plot file for the single color has been produced.
