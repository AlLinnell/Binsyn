Test2 differs from Test1 in the number of orbital longitudes calculated; the geometry of the
components is the same (see Description1.txt in directory Test1 for details on setting the
geometry of the system). Test2 calculates a complete light curve of this eclipsing system for
a wavelength of 5500 Angstroms (set by file PGC.INF). The only changes from Test1 are in file
PGB.INF. Compare the PGB.INF file in directory Test2 with the corresponding PGB.INF file in
directory Test1.

Test2 includes additional programs needed to produce and examine complete light curves and compare with observational data.
