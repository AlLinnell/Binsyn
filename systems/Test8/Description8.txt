This test directory includes a series of individual examples implemented by separate scripts.
The basic model is a binary star system without an accretion disk.

Script1 uses the black body approximation and generates a synthetic light curve. A useful
elaboration is to generate a file of simulated observational data (see the Users Guide) with
the same system parameters as the default parameters in this example. Then vary the parameters
in CALPT.INF, PGB.INF, or PGC.INF, run script1 and note the change in the light curve. (At the
end of the tests, restore the parameters to their default values.)

Script2 runs the programs grpa, grpb, grpc, grpd, grpe sequentially. The outputs of these
programs are needed for differentials correction solutions. Be sure to set the files named
GRP.INF within each program directory for either a black body approximation or synthetic
photometry. See the Users Guide.

Script3 does a differentials correction solution on the black body approximation via program
lgtsyn2. Be sure a data set of "observational" data has been generated and is present in the
file binsyn/oa/VVTST3.MGS. See the Users Manual. Be sure to set the file DIFCORR.INF for the
parameters to be solved for. As a convention, the true parameter values are on line 1 of the
files SUM1.DAT and SUM2.DAT, while the user should insert the corresponding assumed values on 
line 2 of the same files. At the end of the run the updated parameter values are in the
files SUM1.DAT and SUM2.DAT, in this Test8 directory.

Script4 does a differentials correction solution using synthetic photometry. Otherwise this
script follows the same procedure as script3. Be sure there has been a preceding run of script2
with the GRP.INF files set for synthetic photometry. Be sure the files SUM1.DAT and SUM2.DAT have
been initialized as well as file NOIT.DAT.
 
Script5 calculates a synthetic photometry light curve in exact analogy to script1 for the black
body approximation.
