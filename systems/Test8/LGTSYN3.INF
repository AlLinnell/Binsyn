 Value of KCTRL to use in PGB                           KCTRLA :  0
 *  If MODE=0, KCTRLA should = 0 or 2
 *  If MODE=1, KCTRLA should = 1             
 Mode of operation                                      MODE   :  0
 *  If MODE=0, the value of orbital eccen. is .LE. EBRK
 *  If MODE=1, the value of orbital eccen. is .GT. EBRK
 Value of EBRK                                          EBRK   : 0.03
 *  If MODE=0 is selected, LGTSYN1 uses a single run of 
 *  PGC and sets PGB to produce the full set of orbital
 *  longitudes in a single run. In this mode, PGD
 *  produces a full set of light values in a single run.
 *  If MODE=1 is selected, LGTSYN1 runs PGB, PGC, PGD
 *  successively for each orbital longitude. This
 *  choice evaluates component irradiation at each
 *  orbital longitude.
 Value of LACD                                           LACD  : 0
 *  If .NE.0, copy PGCAC output files to PGC output
