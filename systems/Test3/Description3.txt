This test involves a contact binary system. It differs from the example in directory Test2 only in the fact that this is a contact binary. The difference depends only on the choice of Roche potentials in CALPT.INF.

As originally developed, Binsyn included treatment of contact binaries. This feature was 
"temporarily" eliminated when Binsyn was modified to treat binaries with accretion disks.
A future version of Binsyn will reestablish treatment of contact binary systems.
