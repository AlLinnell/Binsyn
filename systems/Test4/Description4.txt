This test involves calculation of a synthetic spectrum for a binary system like that described
in directory Test1 (see Description1.txt in that directory). The test involves additional
programs actually involved in calculation of accretion disk systems; they are included here
because it is necessary to affirmatively state that no accretion disk is involved.

The output includes three synthetic spectra: SYSSM.DAT, SYSC1.DAT, and SYSC2.DAT. The file SYSSM.DAT
is the system synthetic spectrum for the orbital position specified in PGB.INF. That synthetic
spectrum is the sum of the synthetic spectra for the two components: SYSC1.DAT representing the
primary star and SYSC2.DAT representing the secondary star. For plotting, note that the file
SYSSM.DAT must be scaled by about 10^(-30) for an ordinate scale range of 1-10.
