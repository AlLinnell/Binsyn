PRODUCTION OF A SYNTHETIC LIGHT CURVE FOR ANALYSIS

STEP 1: Choose system parameters and set them in CALPT.INF, PGB.INF, PGC.INF.
        Note that it is necessary to decide at this stage whether to produce
		multi-wavelength light curves. If yes, you will need to preserve the
		PGC.INF settings in the solution.

		If you choose a multi-wavelength light curve, in PGC.INF:
		    Set NWL to the number of wavelengths.
			(The software has a limit of NWL=5. If you want more wavelengths
			set up two or more runs.)

			Enter the required number of lines immediately after the line reading
			Wavelengths of observations, using the first line as a guide.
			Do not tab to the WL( ) column.

		Note the last line in PGC.INF. Setting NITER > 0 produces a more accurate
		evaluation of the reflection effect and is important for very close binary
		components. NITER > 0 consumes a lot of time.

STEP 2: Run CALPT, TRANSF1, REPL4, PGA, PGB, PGC, PGD, SPT, and LTCVA.
        It is useful to plot the light curve(s) to be sure the shape is what you want.

STEP 3:	Use PGF to produce a file with the number of entries desired in the final
		synthetic light curve. Do this by setting file IA/PGF.INF. Note the
		description of the control parameters KCTRL and KN (applicable only to PGF).

		Set the parameters RA and RB from the mean radii of the components as listed
		in PGAX1.DAT. Be sure to set the values of VLVID, ECC, and OMD to agree with
		the corresponding entries in PGB.INF.
		Run PGF: Note that the output data file is in /PGFF1.DAT and that there is an
		initial line of identification.
		Note that the format of the tabular lines is (F20.7,F20.7,F5.2). The third
		datum is an entry if weights for the "observations" will be provided; the
		data sequence is Light, Phase, Weight.
		Note that, for the first data line, the entry for Light is 1.0E-7 (NOT 0.0).
		The reason for this is to permit easy use of multi-wavelength light curves.
		A given light curve is terminated with 0.0 in both the Light and Phase columns
		and the first data line with Light not equal to 0 prevents premature exit from
		reading the data set.
		Note that file /PGFF2.DAT provides a log of the PGF run.

STEP 4: Produce a basic light curve for each specified wavelength via SPT.
        Set the format of the input data to SPT, in /SPT.INF, as (F20.7,F20.7,F5.2).
		In /SPT.INF, set KSQ=0, KPD=0.
        Modify SPT.ILS, line 7, by inserting proper reference to file
		/PGFF1.DAT from STEP 3. SPT used the theoretical light curve from PGDX3.DAT,
		referenced on line 8 of SPT.ILS, to interpolate a theoretical light value
		at each phase point specified in file /PGFF1.DAT. The output theoretical
		light curve is in file /PGSX4.DAT. (If there are multiple wavelengths, the
		light curves are "stacked" in sequence, separated by an entry with Light=0.0
		and Phase=0.0). Each light curve has as many entries as in the file /PGFF1.DAT.
		Note that the format of the light curve entries is (F20.7,F20.7,F5.2).
		
STEP 5: Produce the simulated light curve modulated by observational noise with PGS.
        The first line of /PGS.ILS points at the control file /PGS.INF.
		The second line of /PGS.ILS points at /PGSX4.DAT, the theoretical light curve
		produced in STEP 4. There are three output files: /VVTST3.LGT,/VVTST3.MGS,
		and /VVTST3.RES. (The names may be changed to suit the user's convenience.)
		
		In /PGS.INF, set NCOL. Probably leave ELIGHT=1.0. Set SG( ) for the standard
		deviation of residuals, in magnitudes, separately for each wavelength (as in
		PGC.INF, a separate line for each wavelength.)
		Set a reference magnitude for each wavelength, in successive lines, starting
		with RFMG(1).
		Leave the data format as (2F20.7,F5.1).
		Use the reference magnitudes in the analysis of the light curves.
		Note that the first output file provides light units, the second, magnitudes,
		and the third, light residuals (useful for plotting to see what the noise
		looks like.)
		For application to SPT or DIFCORR or LGTSYN2 or another analysis program, use
		/VVTST3.MGS since those programs assume the "observational" data are in magnitudes.
STEP 6: As a cautionary step, since, in STEP 4 file SPT.ILS was changed to reference
        /PGFF1.DAT, reset line 7 of /SPT.ILS to point at /VVTST3.MGS.
