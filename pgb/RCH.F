      SUBROUTINE RCH(I,ITH,K,R,E)
C     THIS SRT CALCULATES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE POTENTIAL FOR
C     SPECIFIED DISTANCE FROM THE ORIGIN ALONG A LINE OF GIVEN DIRECTION 
C     COSINES AND THE SPECIFIED POTENTIAL FOR THAT STAR    
C     THE SPECIFIED POTENTIAL IS IN OM(I)    
C     NOTE THAT THE CALCULATED POTENTIAL IS STORED IN COMMON IN VOM      
C     IF THE DISTANCE IS LESS THAN THE XMNDISTANCE THE NONSYNCHRONOUS    
C     ROTATION PARAMETER FV(I) IS USED
C     IF THE DISTANCE IS GREATER THAN XMNSYNCHRONOUS ROTATION IS ADOPTED 
C     L SPECIFIES THE THETA STRIP     
      INCLUDE 'COMA.FOR'
