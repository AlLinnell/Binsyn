TODO List for project BINSYN

* Change executable filename output to variable from function.
* Build new Makefiles for the new subsystems
* Clean up sub-Makefiles with functions to define srcFiles, objects, etc.
* Do something about PORTLIB, are we keeping this?
  * PGS is the only reference.  Simply removing PORTLIB didn't work, 
  so, its being called somewhere.  Either, find and replace that call,
  or complie and add hooks for PORTLIB in BINSYN build system.
* (related) Convert input/output files to arguments.
* Increase robustness of header auto dependancies in Makefile.
* figure out how to keep binary files out of git repo.
